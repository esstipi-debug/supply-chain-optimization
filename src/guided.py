"""Guided Execution Layer — the "never leave the user unprotected" contract.

Cross-cutting layer (Capability §2.14 of the expansion plan) that wraps every other
capability. Its job is simple and strict: **no task ends in a dead end.** A result is
either EXECUTED safely by the agent, or it carries at least one *executable path* the
human can act on — ranked options, a prepared handoff packet, or an escalation — plus
an explicit statement of any residual the human must cover and the risk of skipping it.

This module is pure (no external deps), mirroring the analytical-core style: frozen
dataclasses + pure functions, with a `verify_guided` QA gate shaped exactly like
``jobs/qa.py`` (returns ``list[str]``; empty == passed).
